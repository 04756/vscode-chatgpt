# Autologin Setup

This option helps you grab the required tokens automatically, without needing to copy/paste tokens around üöÄ.

You only need to provide the extension with the path to your `Chrome` application's path.

1. Enable autologin setting from Settings UI

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gencay/vscode-chatgpt/main/images/autologin-setting.png">

2. Enter the `Chrome` installation locations. The default Windows path is prefilled in the textbox. Change that if you would like to update the `Chrome` path for extension.

   - For reference here are the defaults:
     - Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
     - MAC: /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome;

3. Login to OpenAI as usual and solve captchas when prompted.
4. The `Chrome` page will be closed automatically once we grab the required tokens.

# Manual Setup

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com and log in.
2. Open your browser's developer tools
   - Hit F12 to open the developer tools in most browsers
   - Alternatively, right click on the browser window and select `Inspect`
3. Go to `Application` -> `Cookies` -> `https://chat.openai.com`. You will need the following cookies:
   - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`: The extension will use this to send prompts to ChatGPT
   - `cf_clearance`: CloudFlare clearance token. A security measure OpenAI put in place to block automated access.
4. Go to `Console` and type in the following code to get your `user-agent`
   - `navigator.userAgent`: This is your browser's user-agent, needed for CloudFlare clearance. Enter the value of `userAgent` when prompted by the extension. Copy its value **without single or double quotes**.
5. Now that you have all required session variables, run any command using the extension and you'll be asked to enter these values:
   - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`: An encoded token starting with `ey***`
   - `cf_clearance`: An alpha-numeric token
   - `userAgent`

# Troubleshooting

- If the bot isn't responding, try clearing your cache by running the `ChatGPT: Clear session` command.
- It's possible that openai systems may experience issues responding to your queries due to high-traffic from time to time.
- If you get `ChatGPTAPI error 429`, it means that you are making Too Many Requests. Please wait and try again in a few moments. If it persists, restart your vs-code.
- If you see `ChatGPTAPI error terminated`, your requests are being throttled. Please try again later.
