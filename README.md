[![Badge for version for Visual Studio Code extension gencay.vscode-chatgpt](https://vsmarketplacebadges.dev/version/gencay.vscode-chatgpt.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gencay.vscode-chatgpt)

## üì¢ December 25 Update

The extension is expected to work without any 403s or 429s since it will now use the browser behind the scenes to make the chatGPT requests. Please make sure that `autologin` setting is set to `true` (default is `true`) and you keep the `Chrome` browser open all the time after logging in. It'll be automatically minimized after successful login. You can then ask questions to ChatGPT via the extension as usual.

# ChatGPT as your copilot to level up your developer experience

- ü§ñ Zero-Config setup. Simply login to OpenAI as usual.
- ‚û°Ô∏è Export all your conversation history at once in Markdown format.
- üîÉ Option to clear and restart the conversation with ChatGPT.
- üçª Optimized for dialogue! Have a conversation with ChatGPT with follow-ups.
- üíØ Get help from ChatGPT within vs-code for implementing test cases, explaining it or finding bugs.
- üìù Create projects/files with one click using built-in actions in the conversation view.
- ‚ö° Built-in syntax highlighting for ChatGPT suggested code using the default code-font of your Visual Studio Code!
- üñºÔ∏è Icon is generated by dall-e-2.

# Setup

1. Click on extension icon on your sidebar and hit `Login` button.

2. A new `Chrome` window will open up redirected to https://chat.openai.com/. Wait till you see login page, and click on Login on your browser.

3. Solve captchas if you are prompted and continue.

4. After successfully logging in, the browser will be minimized.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You will need to have a browser open and be logged in at all times. If you close the browser or your VS-Code instance, you will be asked to login again in your next session.

üìù You can auto-fill the email address and/or password during logins. Update the extension settings with those information for quicker login.

ü§ñ Below is a sample autologin flow. Simply login & keep your browser minimized for dialogues with ChatGPT:

# üöÄüéâ Zero Configuration (Automated Authentication)

- Zero-Config Autologin lets the extension grab the required tokens automatically using `puppeteer`. The extension will use the browser behind the scenes, so you are not expected to receive 4xx errors while asking ChatGPT via extension unless there is OpenAI outages.

- **2 options to run ChatGPT assistant in your vs-code**:

  1. [**Recommended**] Autologin - Uses browser to ask questions to ChatGPT.
  2. Manually login on a browser and grab required tokens. Described in [Manual Setup](#manual-setup). This option has problems due to using unofficial OpenAI API usage and rate-limiting.

# Features

The extension comes with context menu commands, copy/move suggested code into editor with one-click, conversation window and customization options for OpenAI's ChatGPT prompts.

## Manual Setup

‚ÑπÔ∏è This method is no longer recommended since hard rate-limiting by OpenAI services. Please use the `AutoLogin` option with Zero-Configuration required.

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com and login.
2. Open your browser's developer tools
   - Hit F12 to open the developer tools in most browsers
   - Alternatively, right click on the browser window and select `Inspect`
3. Go to `Application` -> `Cookies` -> `https://chat.openai.com`. You will need the following cookies:
   - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`: The extension will use this to send prompts to ChatGPT
   - `cf_clearance`: CloudFlare clearance token. A security measure OpenAI put in place to block automated access.
4. Go to `Console` and type in the following code to get your `user-agent`
   - `navigator.userAgent`: This is your browser's user-agent, needed for CloudFlare clearance. Enter the value of `userAgent` when prompted by the extension. Copy its value **without single or double quotes**.
5. Now that you have all required session variables, run any command using the extension and you'll be asked to enter these values:
   - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`: An encoded token starting with `ey***`
   - `cf_clearance`: An alpha-numeric token
   - `userAgent`

# Troubleshooting

- It's possible that openai systems may experience issues responding to your queries due to high-traffic from time to time.
- If you get `ChatGPTAPI error 429`, it means that you are making Too Many Requests. Please wait and try again in a few moments. If it persists, restart your vs-code.
- If you see `ChatGPTAPI error terminated`, your requests are being throttled. Please try again later.
- If you encounter persistent issues with your queries, try restarting your VS-Code and retry logging in.
